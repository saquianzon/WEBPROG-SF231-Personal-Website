        <p> IT Experience </p>
        <p> Programming </p>
            <p> - My experience in programming is quite limited as I know some basics in Python, Java, and a bit 
            of HTML but not much in other coding languages. </p>

        <p> Computer Hardware and Server Configuration </p>
            <p> - During my senior high years, I took the TVL-ICT track and I spent my time learning about the 
                parts of a computer along with cable networking and installation and configuration of windows 
                operating systems and servers. </p>
        
        <p> Hobbies & Interests </p>
        <p> Digital Drawing</p>
        <p> During my spare time, I'd read eBooks or spend my time doing digital drawing. These hobbies 
            help me de-stress as well as allow me to express my creativity and ideas that inspire me to 
            create stories or observe how nature works. I also occasionally play ukulele especially during 
            events. </p>
        

        <p> Goals In Life/Dream </p>
        <p> I am an international volunteer from over 240 lands. I'm one of 
            Jehovah's Witnesses and we reach out to people to share advice from the Bible and God's 
            wonderful promises for the earth in the near future. I want to help share that message where all 
            bad things including suffering, sickness, injustice, poverty and even death will be no more 
            because of my love for God, whose personal name is Jehovah. By also having love for my 
            neighbor and all sorts of people, it motivates me to reach that goal along with other fellow 
            volunteers.
            </p>
                <p> - As I aspire to be a 2D professional artist/animator. I've been seeing videos and films showing the 
                      insane skill and talent of different artists and it inspired me to try and hopefully achieve that 
                      level if possible. In the meantime, I'd like to hone my drawing skills for now. </p>
                <p> - I also want to learn how to play the piano, I love its versatility and calming effect it gives to me. </p>
                <p> - I dream to have a cat. I need a cat. If only it weren't for my asthma, I'd have one right now. </p>
