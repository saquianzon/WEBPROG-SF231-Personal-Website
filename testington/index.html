        <p> "Have you no regard for our sled members?" Iris shouted frantically. "My son and my mate are still stuck out there in the blazing storm, no one's leaving until we find them. We have to keep searching!" <br> <br>

            Falcon went to stand in front of her before she made another step. "Mother, I'm grateful that you too want to find our family, but we won't make any progress under this harsh weather." His voice was calm, but he was worried if Iris would listen to her firstborn in such a confused and alarmed state. <br> 
            "We'll find them for sure, just not today." <br> <br>
            
            Iris stared at Falcon for a moment, then she let out a long defeated sigh. <br>
            <br>
            "I don't know, son. We have no idea what happened to them after their leashes tore away from the sled. What if they strayed too far? How would Sparrow survive on his own if Hato doesn't find him? What if a predator finds them first before we do? Oh Falcon, we should not have allowed them to take the other sled! None of this would have ever happened if we traveled together as a family."</p>
